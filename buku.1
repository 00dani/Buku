.SH NAME
buku \- Bookmark manager. Your private Google.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B buku
.I OPTIONS
.RI [ URL ]
.RI [ TAGS ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B buku
is a command line tool to save and search bookmarks.
.PP
The SQLite3 database file is stored in $HOME/.cache/bookmarks.db for each user.
.SH OPERATIONAL NOTES
URL must precede the tags. Manual title with multiple keywords must be within quotes.
.PP
It's advisable to copy URLs directly from the browser address bar, i.e., along with the leading 'http://' or 'https://' token. buku looks up title data (found within <title></title> tags of HTML) from the web ONLY for fully-formed HTTP(S) URLs.
.PP
If the URL contains characters like ';', '&' or brackets they may be interpreted specially by the shell. To avoid it, add the URL within single ''' or double '"' qoutes.
.PP
The same URL cannot be added twice. You can update tags and re-fetch title data. You can also delete it and insert at the same index.
.PP
You can either add or update or delete record(s) in one instance. A combination of these operations is not supported in a single run.
.PP
Search works in mysterious ways:
  - Substrings match ('match' matches 'rematched') for URL, tags and title.
  - All the keywords are treated together as a 'single' tag in the 'same order'. Bookmarks with partial or complete tag matches are shown in results.
  - '-s' : match any of the keywords in URL or title. Order is irrelevant.
  - '-S' : match all the keywords in URL or title. Order is irrelevant. 
  - Search results are indexed serially. This index is different from actual database index of a bookmark reord which is shown within '()' after the URL.
.PP
Encryption support is manual. Database file should be unlocked ('-k') before using buku and locked ('-l') afterwards. Note that the database file is unecrypted on creation. AES256 is used for encryption. Optionally specify ('-t') the number of hash iterations to use to generate key. Default is 8 iterations.
